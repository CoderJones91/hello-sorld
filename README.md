To store some ideas, inspirational quotes, and resources. 

Greetings all, I'm Anthony Jones and I currently work as a QA Engineer. I have aspirations to become a front-end developer/web designer. I started self-teaching myslef how to code about a year ago with Youtube tutorials and a subscription to Codeschool. However, I'll honestly have to say that most of my knowledge thus far has came from plenty of trial and error.
